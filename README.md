# RLProject
A small research project comparing Q-learning with double Q-learning.

All python files here are used for experimentation:

run_cliffw.py links with main2.py

whereas all other docs: arn.py, red.py, ren.py, tho.py run_experiment.py etc. link to main.py

Algorithms, policies and environment set-up code can be found in their designated folder.
